//! A generic display interface
//!
//! This crate contains an error type and traits to implement for bus interface drivers drivers to
//! be consumed by display drivers. It abstracts over the different communication methods available
//! to drive a display and allows a driver writer to focus on driving the display itself and only
//! have to implement a single interface.
